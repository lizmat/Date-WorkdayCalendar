The `WorkdayCalendar` and `Workdate` objects allow date calculations to be
made on a calendar that considers workdays (also called "business days").

Built on top of the `Date` datatype, it uses a calendar file to specify how
many days a workweek has and which days are to be considered holidays.

By default, the workweek is composed of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday.  Saturday and Sunday form the weekend.

Although most countries have a Monday to Friday workweek, some have very
different ones.

More information about workweeks can be found at
